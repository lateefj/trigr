## Who needs another build system?

TLDR: Me and hopefully you!

Features 

* Decentralized: able to run on a development system (laptop)
* Automated Configuration: getting software packaged for use is often a Rube Goldberg process that is only made worse by user interfaces
* Modern Interface: a web ui not for configuration but for monitoring builds
